====

Refactor all the ugly, repetitive code, especially in the Authenticate module

  Make a distinct ConfigFile type that is turned into a Config in a separate step

    This step should run in IO so that keys can be loaded.
  
  Generate lenses for Session and Config

  Generate getters for parts of Request

  Write convenient lenses for switching around between text and (lazy-)bytestrings

  Put the Config and Request in a Reader monad

  Put the Session in a State monad

  Raise errors via exceptions

Don't refuse to proxy just due to lack of authentication; instead, proxy all
non-reserved paths, but just don't make an authentication claim in the headers if
there is no authenticated user.

  Basically, the authentication routes should be pulled up to the top level,
  and proxying should become the default.

Add /check-login and /logout routes to the authenticated branch

Add a signed header when proxying that indicates the client's verified email

Set the secure bit on the client cookie

Add a config entry indicating where to redirect after a successful login

Make all tokens time-limited

Deploy to a real server with SSL via haproxy

Add a custom stylesheet option
