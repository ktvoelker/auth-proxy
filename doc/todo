Add support for an arbitrary redirect after verification

  Accept a query arg in GET /login, embedded in the form so it comes back to
  POST /login. On POST /login, save the redirect URI into the session. On GET
  /verify, redirect to the stored URI.

Set the secure bit on the client cookie

Allow the config option for the email domain to be a list of domains

Make all tokens time-limited

Add a custom stylesheet option

Add a mode where we redirect externally instead of proxying
